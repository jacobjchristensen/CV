  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have elevated LDL cholesterol from the first year of life, and represent a model of early-stage atherosclerosis. Data suggest that adults with FH have alterations in circulating monocyte subpopulations towards a more pro-inflammatory phenotype, but it is not known whether FH children have similar perturbations. In addition, there are no data on the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations in FH children. The objective of the present study was to characterize the distributions of circulating monocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations in children with FH and healthy, normocholesterolemic children.
METHODS: Using flow cytometry analysis, we analyzed whole blood B- and T-cell subpopulations and monocyte subpopulations in FH (n~=~23) and healthy (n~=~20) children. Moreover, we measured serum markers of leukocyte and endothelial cell activation using EIA.
RESULTS: We found that FH children had monocytosis as well as a shift in the monocyte subpopulations. This shift was characterized by higher circulating pro-inflammatory and non-classical monocytes, and lower levels of classical monocytes, and seemed to be present only in FH children with low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C, below 1.3~mmol/L). Additionally, monocytes expressing CD18 and serum E-selectin were higher in FH children, in particular FH children with low HDL-C.
CONCLUSIONS: FH children with low HDL-C had monocytosis as well as a shift in monocyte subpopulations towards a more pro-inflammatory phenotype. Our results suggest activation of monocytes at a very early stage of atherosclerosis in humans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), accelerated atherosclerosis, and premature cardiovascular disease. Whereas children with lifestyle-induced dyslipidemias often present with complex lipid abnormalities, children with FH have isolated hypercholesterolemia. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive profiling of FH children is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the lipid-related and metabolic alterations associated with elevated LDL-C in children with FH and healthy children.
METHODS: We measured plasma metabolites in children with FH (n~=~47) and in healthy children (n~=~57) using a high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy platform, and compared the differences between FH and healthy children.
RESULTS: Both statin treated (n~=~17) and non-statin treated FH children (n~=~30) had higher levels of atherogenic ApoB-containing lipoproteins and lipids, and lipid fractions in lipoprotein subclasses, compared to healthy children (n~=~57). FH children displayed alterations in HDL particle concentration and lipid content, compared with healthy children. Interestingly, the small HDL particles were characterized by higher content of cholesteryl esters, and lower levels of free cholesterol and phospholipids. Furthermore, plasma fatty acids were higher in non-statin treated FH children, particularly linoleic acid. Finally, acetoacetate and acetate were lower in FH children compared with healthy children.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypercholesterolemia in children associates with diverse metabolic repercussions and is more complex than previously believed. In particular, we found that hypercholesterolemia in FH children was paralleled not only by increased atherogenic ApoB-containing lipoproteins and lipid fractions, but also alterations in HDL subfractions that suggest impaired reverse cholesterol transport.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity, a major cause of death and disability, is increasing worldwide. Obesity is characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state which is suggested to play a critical role in the development of obesity-related diseases like cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. In fact, in the hours following consumption of a meal, a transient increase in inflammatory markers occurs, a response that is exaggerated in obese subjects. Dietary composition, including content of dietary fatty acids, may affect this inflammatory response both acutely and chronically, and thereby be predictive of progression of disease. The aim of the review was to summarize the literature from 2010 to 2016 regarding the effects of dietary fat intake on levels of inflammatory markers in overweight and obesity in human randomized controlled trials.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases. The literature search included human randomized controlled trials, both postprandial and long-term interventions, from January 2010 to September 2016. In total, 37 articles were included. Interventions with dairy products, vegetable oils, or nuts showed minor effects on inflammatory markers. The most consistent inflammatory-mediating effects were found in intervention with whole diets, which suggests that many components of the diet reduce inflammation synergistically. Furthermore, interventions with weight reduction and different fatty acids did not clearly show beneficial effects on inflammatory markers.
CONCLUSION: Most interventions showed either no or minor effects of dietary fat intake on inflammatory markers in overweight and obese subjects. To progress our understanding on how diet and dietary components affect our health, mechanistic studies are required. Hence, future studies should include whole diets and characterization of obese phenotypes at a molecular level, including omics data and gut microbiota.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Replacing dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces the plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and subsequently the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, beyond changes in LDL cholesterol, we lack a complete understanding of the physiologic alterations that occur when improving dietary fat quality.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to gain knowledge of metabolic alterations paralleling improvements in the fat quality of the diet.
METHODS: We recently conducted an 8-wk, double-blind, randomized controlled trial replacing SFAs with PUFAs in healthy subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (n~=~99). In the present substudy, we performed comprehensive metabolic profiling with multiple platforms (both nuclear magnetic resonance- and mass spectrometry-based technology) (n~=~99), and analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression (n~=~95) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: A large number of lipoprotein subclasses, myristoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine, and kynurenine were reduced when SFAs were replaced with PUFAs. In contrast, bile acids, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, acetate, and acetoacetate were increased by the intervention. Some amino acids were also altered by the intervention. The mRNA levels of LXRA and LDLR were increased, in addition to several liver X receptor α target genes and genes involved in inflammation, whereas the mRNA levels of UCP2 and PPARD were decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after replacing SFAs with PUFAs. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that the 30 most important variables that contributed to class separation spanned all classes of biomarkers, and was in accordance with the univariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying metabolomics in randomized controlled dietary intervention trials has the potential to extend our knowledge of the biological and molecular effects of dietary fat quality. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01679496.},
